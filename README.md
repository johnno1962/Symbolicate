# Symbolicate crash files for OS X

Copyright (c) John Holdsworth 2014

Simple app to symbolicate ".crash" dumps from Mac App Store Apps.

Drag the crash file onto the icon of this application or use "File/Open..."
then drag Xcode's .xcarchive file (displayed when you show the app's
archive in Finder) onto this application's icon and it should resolve
symbols down to the line number.

Any problems let me know though the symbolicate (at) johnholdsworth.com
